# LiDAR-case-study

In this scenario, we have been hired by an electricity network to help process Drone based LiDAR data of 
their electricity lines. Our task is to create a python package that can iden$fy how many wires are present in 
a lidar point cloud and generate 3D catenary models of these wires.
